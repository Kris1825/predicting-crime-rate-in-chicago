# Predict Crime Rate in Chicago
- This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting crime trends in the city of Chicago using the Chicago Crime Dataset.
- The dataset contains a summary of all reported crimes in Chicago between 2001 and 2017, covering several million records.
- The main goal of this project is to explore historical patterns in crime data and use **Facebook Prophet**  to predict future crime rates.
